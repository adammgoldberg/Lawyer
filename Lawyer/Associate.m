//The associate will return a number for how much the client will have to pay the lawyer. Add logic that if the clientâ€™s description of the problem is under 10 characters, the lawyer will bill 5 hours, if the description is between 10 and 20 characters, the lawyer will bill 10 hours, and for anything above the lawyer will bill 25 hours.
